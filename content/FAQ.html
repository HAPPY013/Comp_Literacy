<p2 style="text-align: center;" >: Are there Training Resources available for the CompLiteracy content upload process (Video tutorials, PowerPoint presentations, Webinars etc.)? </p2>
<p3>Q: Is CompLiteracy just a repository, or an LMS?
    Answer: SkillsCommons is a repository. It is not an LMS. If you have courses built in an LMS, they can be exported in a zip file and then uploaded into SkillsCommons.
    
    Note that you may want to export your course in both an LMS-specific format and the IMS Common Cartridge format, if your LMS offers the option.   You can then submit both sets of files.  The LMS-specific format will provide the highest fidelity when someone imports the content into the same LMS brand at their institution.  The Common Cartridge format may provide the best option when importing into an LMS that is different from the one where the export was made.</p3>
