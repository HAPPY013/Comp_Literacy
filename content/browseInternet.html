        <p>
            A <b>web browser</b> is a type of software that allows you to find and view websites on the Internet. There are many different web browsers, but some of the most common ones include <b>Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Microsoft Edge,</b> and <b>Mozilla Firefox.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
           
            <div class="row">
                <b>URLs and the address bar</b>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="images/Picture11.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        Each website has a unique address, called a <b>URL</b> (short for <b>Uniform Resource Locator</b>). It's like a street address that tells your browser where to go on the Internet. When you type a URL into the browser's <b>address bar</b> and press <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard, the browser will load the page associated with that URL.
                        In the example below, we've typed <u>www.bbc.com/travel</u> into the address bar.
                    </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Links</h2>
                     Whenever you see a word or phrase on a website that's blue or underlined in blue, it's probably a hyperlink, or link for short. Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will usually take you to a different webpage. You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever you hover over a link.
                <br>
                <br>

                <div class="column">
                    The <b>Back</b> and <b>Forward</b> buttons allow you to move through websites you've recently viewed. You can also click and hold either button to see your recent history.

                    <br>

                    The <b>Refresh</b> button will <b>reload</b> the current page. If a website stops working, try using the Refresh button. <br>

                <div class="column">
                    Many browsers allow you to open links in a new tab. You can open as many links as you want, and they'll stay in the <b>same browser</b> window instead of cluttering your screen with multiple windows.
                    To open a link in a new tab, <b>right-click</b> the link and select <b>Open link in new tab</b> (the exact wording may vary from browser to browser).

                    Links don't always go to another website. In some cases, they point to a <b>file</b> that can be <b>downloaded,</b> or saved, to your computer. <br>
                    If you click a link to a file, it may download automatically, but sometimes it just <b>opens within your browser</b> instead of downloading. To prevent it from opening in the browser, you can <b>right-click</b> the link and select <b>Save link</b> as (different browsers may use slightly different wording, like <b>Save target as)</b>.
