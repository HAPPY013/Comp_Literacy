            The <b>arrow/cursor/pointer</b> is the visual cue that points, moves, and selects things on monitor. You can remember this as your “electronic finger” that points to things on your computer screen (monitor). The mouse pointer is somewhat like your virtual finger inside the computer. It may change shapes as you move it around the screen – which gives you a visual cue that the function of the pointer has changed. The mouse pointer is in the shape of an arrow as you point to icons, menu choices, toolbar buttons, etc.
