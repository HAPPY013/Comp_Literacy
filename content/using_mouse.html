    <h1>How To Use A Mouse</h1>  
   
    <p>
        The mouse can be used in many different ways. There are primarily the two mouse buttons, known as the left and right button. The left button is primarily used. Some mouse techniques include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Click</b> This is the easiest of the techniques, however it is very important that you do it properly. To click, you press down one of the mouse buttons. As you click it, it makes a “clicking” noise. The most important skill to learn when clicking is that it only takes a very light, short tap to click a mouse button. Don’t click the mouse too hard since this tends to slow you down. Once you have mastered clicking, you will be ready to move on to the next most essential practice, pointing. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Left Clicking</b> This is the primary “click” that you will use. This is clicking on the left mouse button. When someone says, “click here,” that usually means to left click. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Right Clicking</b> This is used to change options or perform specific functions that aren’t usually necessary for beginner.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Point</b> Use the mouse to move the mouse pointer so that it hovers over the top of an icon or word on the screen. Sometimes, this is all that you need to do in order to prompt a response from the computer (as an example, the shape of your cursor may change).

        <b>Point and click</b> Move the mouse pointer over the top of an item (such as an icon) on your screen and then (while holding your hand still) gently press and release the left button on the mouse. This technique is often used to make a selection
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Double-click</b> : While hovering the mouse pointer over an item on the screen, quickly press the left mouse button two times. This may take some practice, but it is a very useful and important skill. If you are having problems double clicking, it’s most likely because you’re moving the mouse slightly when double 
        clicking. Try to steady your hand and try it again. By double clicking, you are usually prompting the computer to take an action on the item you selected (double clicking on an icon on your computer desktop may open or start a program).
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Click and drag</b> : Press and hold down a mouse button (usually the left button). As you hold down the button, move the mouse in any direction. Click and drag is a method used when “highlighting” or “selecting” text. To do this to text, click at the beginning of the text that you want to select, hold down the left mouse button, and move your mouse to the end of where you want to highlight. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The Right Mouse Button</b> What happens if you accidentally press the right mouse button? A menu pops up— and it’s not a problem, but it can make the computer do something that you don’t expect if you then click on the menu. For now, avoid “confusing” the computer. If you accidentally right click and open a box, left click in an open space (see picture) and the box will close.
